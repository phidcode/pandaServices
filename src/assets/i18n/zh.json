      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_TITLE": "如何计算月供能力", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P1": "Lenders look at two ratios when determining the mortgage amount you qualify for, which generally indicate how much you can afford. These ratios are called the Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio and Total Debt Service (TDS) ratio. They take into account your income, monthly housing costs and overall debt load.", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P2": "The first affordability rule, as set out by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), is that your monthly housing costs – mortgage principal and interest, taxes and heating expenses (P.I.T.H.) - should not exceed 32% of your gross household monthly income. For condominiums, P.I.T.H. also includes half of your monthly condominium fees. The sum of these housing costs as a percentage of your gross monthly income is your GDS ratio.", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P3": "The CMHC’s second affordability rule is that your total monthly debt load, including housing costs, should not be more than 40% of your gross monthly income. In addition to housing costs, your total monthly debt load would include credit card interest, car payments, and other loan expenses. The sum of your total monthly debt load as a percentage of your gross household income is your TDS ratio.", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P4": "Note that while the industry guideline for GDS and TDS is 32% and 40% respectively, most borrowers with good credit and steady income will be allowed to exceed these limits. The maximum allowed is 39% and 44%. The calculator uses these maximums to estimate affordability.", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_GDSR": "assets/images/TDSR.png", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_TDSR": "assets/images/GDSR.png", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_TITLE": "首期付款", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_P1": "Your down payment is a benchmark used to determine your maximum affordability. Ignoring income and debt levels, you can determine how much you can afford to spend using a simple calculation:", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_P2": "If your down payment is $25,000 or less, you can find your maximum purchase price using this formula: down payment / 5% = maximum affordability. If your down payment is $25,001 or more, you can find your maximum purchase price using this formula: down payment amount - $25,000 / 10% + $500,000. For example, if you have saved $50,000 for your down payment, the maximum home price you could afford would be $50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000 / 10% = $250,000 + $500,000 = $750,000. Any mortgage with less than a 20% down payment is known as a high-ratio mortgage, and requires you to purchase mortgage default insurance, commonly referred to as CMHC insurance.", 
      "CASH_REQ_OTHER_QUALIFICATIONS_TITLE": "所需现金及其他满足贷款条件", 
      "CASH_REQ_OTHER_QUALIFICATIONS_CONTENT": "In addition to your down payment and CMHC insurance, you should set aside 1.5% - 4% of your home's selling price to cover closing costs, which are payable on closing day. Many home buyers forget to account for closing costs in their cash requirement. In addition to your debt service ratios, down payment, and cash for closing costs, mortgage lenders will also consider your credit history and your income when qualifying you for a mortgage. All of these factors are equally important. For example even if you have good credit, a sizeable down payment, and no debts, but an unstable income, you might have difficulty getting approved for a mortgage. Keep in mind that the mortgage affordability calculator can only provide an estimate of how much you'll be approved for, and assumes you’re an ideal candidate for a mortgage. To get the most accurate picture of what you qualify for, speak to a mortgage broker about getting a mortgage pre-approval.",

      "FAQ4TITLE": "問: 固定利率与浮动利率?",
      "FAQ4SECTION":"固定利率是指您的利率以及本金和利息还款额在整个房屋贷款期限内不变。如果您是首次购房者，并且希望了解须偿还的确切金额，固定利率房屋贷款将是明智的选择。对于浮动利率房屋贷款，利率将随着道明房屋贷款最优惠利率的变化而波动。您的本金和利息还款额将在房屋贷款期限内保持不变，但如果道明房屋贷款最优惠利率降低，则还款额中用于偿还本金的金额将提高。如果道明房屋贷款最优惠利率上调，则用于偿还利息的金额将提高1。如果您担心利率上调，则固定利率房屋贷款将是更适合的选择，因为在房屋贷款期限内，您的利率不会提高。如果利率下调，则浮动利率房屋贷款将是更适宜的选择。如果您选择了浮动利率房屋贷款，而利率开始上升，您可以选择改为固定利率房屋贷款，利率以现行利率为准，具体须遵守某些条件。",
      "FAQ5TITLE": "Q: What credit score do I need to qualify?",
      "FAQ5SECTION":"Generally speaking, you’re a prime candidate for a mortgage if your credit score is 680 and above.

      "FAQ6SECTION_LI2_CONTENT":"Racking up a large amount and then paying it off in monthly instalments can hurt your credit score.

      "FAQ6SECTION_LI3_CONTENT":"If your lender is slower at reporting monthly transactions, this can have a significant impact on how other lenders view your file. Ensure everything’s up to date as old bills that have been paid can come back to haunt you. Some financial institutions don’t even report your maximum limits. As such, the credit bureau is left to only use the balance that’s on hand. The problem is, if you consistently charge the same amount each month – say $1,000 to $1,500 – it may appear to the credit-scoring agencies that you’re regularly maxing out your cards. The best bet is to pay your balances down or off before your statement periods close.",
