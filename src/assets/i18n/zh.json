      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_TITLE": "如何计算月供能力", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P1": "通常贷款机构通过两项指标来决定申请人是否符合所申请的贷款额度，分别是毛偿债率（GDSR）和总偿债率（TDSR），这两项债率是通过计算各项支出所占收入的比例来衡量申请人的负担能力。", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P2": "毛偿债率（GDSR）是申请人所需支付的房屋成本（房贷供款+房产税+供暖费）与税前总收入的比率，一般要求小于32%～34%。这里的房屋供款是指包括本金和利息在内的实际还款额，如果房产为公寓则房屋成本还需要包括物业管理费的一半。", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P3": "总偿债率（TDSR）是申请人的固定支出与税前总收入的比率，一般要求小于40%～44%。与毛偿债率（GDSR）不同的是，固定支出部分除了房屋成本外，还需要包括其他债务，如：信用卡、车贷、学生贷款、其他贷款（指如果不付款，会造成债务余额增加的贷款）、子女或配偶赡养费（如适用），等等。请注意，RRSP，汽车保险，房屋保险，人寿保险，是不需要计算在内的，因为停止付款并不会造成债务余额的增加。", 
      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_P4": "虽然行业内准则要求毛偿债率（GDSR）和总偿债率（TDSR）分别不能低于32%和40%，但如果申请者具备良好的信用记录及稳定的收入，大多数贷款机构都会放款限度。毛偿债率（GDSR）和总偿债率（TDSR）的最大限度分别为39%和44%。",

      "HOW_TO_ESTIMATE_TDSR": "assets/images/TDSR_ZH.png", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_TITLE": "首期付款", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_P1": "您所支付的首付是用于衡量您的最大负担额度的基本条件。忽略收入及债务水平，我们可以用以下的简单公式进行计算：", 
      "DOWN_PAYMENT_P2": "如果您的首付是少于或等于$25,000，您所能负担的最大额度为：首付除以5%。如果您的首付是多于%25,000，则您所能负担的最大额度为（首付 - $25,000）除以10%再加上$500,000。举个例子，如果您的首付为$50,000，则您所能负担的最大房价为（$50,000 - $25,000 = $25,000）/ 10% = $250,000 + $500,000 = $750,000。任何少于20%的首付的贷款被视为高风险贷款，是需要购买贷款毁约保险的，即CMHC贷款保险。", 
      "CASH_REQ_OTHER_QUALIFICATIONS_TITLE": "所需现金及其他满足贷款条件", 
      "CASH_REQ_OTHER_QUALIFICATIONS_CONTENT": "除首付以及CMHC贷款保险外，您还需另外计算并预留一笔交易费用，交易费通常占房产卖出价格的1.5%~4%。除了您的偿债率、首付以及交易费外，贷款机构还会把您的信用记录及收入状况考虑进去以决定是否放贷。上述所说的所有因素都同等重要。比方说即使申请人具备良好的信用记录、无债务以及有能力支付一笔可观的首付但无稳定收入，贷款机构也未必会放贷。请注意以上的计算器仅作说明和一般参考用途，是建立在您满足所有贷款条件的假设之上。实际付款数额可能有所不同，将在签署房屋贷款协议时确定。如需得到更精确的计算请与我们联系。",

      "FAQ4SECTION":"固定利率是指您的利率以及本金和利息还款额在整个房屋贷款期限内不变。如果您是首次购房者，并且希望了解须偿还的确切金额，固定利率房屋贷款将是明智的选择。对于浮动利率房屋贷款，利率将随着道明房屋贷款最优惠利率的变化而波动。您的本金和利息还款额将在房屋贷款期限内保持不变，但如果道明房屋贷款最优惠利率降低，则还款额中用于偿还本金的金额将提高。如果道明房屋贷款最优惠利率上调，则用于偿还利息的金额将提高1。如果您担心利率上调，则固定利率房屋贷款将是更适合的选择，因为在房屋贷款期限内，您的利率不会提高。如果利率下调，则浮动利率房屋贷款将是更适宜的选择。如果您选择了浮动利率房屋贷款，而利率开始上升，您可以选择改为固定利率房屋贷款，利率以现行利率为准，具体须遵守某些条件。",
      "FAQ5TITLE": "问: What credit score do I need to qualify?",
      "FAQ5SECTION":"Generally speaking, you’re a prime candidate for a mortgage if your credit score is 680 and above. The higher you can get above 700 the better, as you will qualify for the lowest rates. These days almost anyone can obtain a mortgage, but the key for those with lower credit scores is the size of the down payment. If you have a sufficient downpayment, you can reduce the risk to the lender providing you with the mortgage. Statistics show that default rates on mortgages decline as the downpayment increases.",

      "FAQ6SECTION_LI1_CONTENT":"The number one way to increase your credit score is to pay down your credit cards so they’re below 70% of your limits. Revolving credit like credit cards seems to have a more significant impact on credit scores than car loans, lines of credit, and so on.",
      "FAQ6SECTION_LI2_HEAD":"Limit the use of credit cards: ",
      "FAQ6SECTION_LI2_CONTENT":"Racking up a large amount and then paying it off in monthly instalments can hurt your credit score. If there is a balance at the end of the month, this affects your score – credit formulas don’t take into account the fact that you may have paid the balance off the next month.",

      "FAQ6SECTION_LI3_CONTENT":"If your lender is slower at reporting monthly transactions, this can have a significant impact on how other lenders view your file. Ensure everything’s up to date as old bills that have been paid can come back to haunt you. Some financial institutions don’t even report your maximum limits. As such, the credit bureau is left to only use the balance that’s on hand. The problem is, if you consistently charge the same amount each month – say $1,000 to $1,500 – it may appear to the credit-scoring agencies that you’re regularly maxing out your cards. The best bet is to pay your balances down or off before your statement periods close.",

      "FAQ6SECTION_LI4_CONTENT":"Older credit is better credit. If you stop using older credit cards, the issuers may stop updating your accounts.
