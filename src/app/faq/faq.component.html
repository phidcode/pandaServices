      <h4>Q: How much money do I need for a down payment?</h4>
      <p>
      The minimum down payment required is 5% of the purchase price of the home. 
      And in order to avoid paying mortgage default insurance, you need to have at least a 20% down payment. 
      </p>
        
      <h4>Q: What happens if I don’t have the full down payment amount?</h4>
      <p>There are programs available that enable you to use other forms of down payment, such as from your RRSPs, a cash-back product, or a gift.
      </p>

      <h4>Q: What will a lender look at when qualifying me for a mortgage?</h4>
      <p>Most lenders look at six factors when determining whether you qualify for a mortgage: </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Income:</b> One of the first things a lender will consider is how much of your total income you’ll be spending on housing. 
                This helps the lender decide whether you can comfortably afford a house.</li>
            <li><b>Debts:</b> A lender will then look at your debts, which generally include monthly house payments as well as payments on all loans, credit cards, child support, etc. </li>
            <li><b>Employment History: </b>A history of steady employment, usually within the same job for several years, helps you qualify. But a short history in your current job shouldn’t prevent you from getting a mortgage, as long as there have been no gaps in income over the past two years.</li>
            <li><b>Credit History:</b> Good credit is also very important in qualifying for a mortgage.</li>
            <li><b>Value of the Property: </b>The lender will also want to know that the house is worth the price you plan to pay.</li>
            <li><b>Downpayment:</b> The larger your downpayment, the higher chance you will get approved. </li>
          </ol>

      <h4>Q: Should I go with a fixed- or variable-rate mortgage?</h4>
      <p>
      The answer to this question depends on your personal risk tolerance. If, for instance, you’re a first-time homebuyer and/or you have a set budget that you can comfortably spend on your mortgage, it’s smart to lock into a fixed mortgage with predictable payments over a specific period of time. If, however, your financial situation can handle the fluctuations of a variable-rate mortgage, this may save you some money over the long run. Another option is to opt for a variable rate, but make payments based on what you would have paid if you selected a fixed rate. Finally, there are also 50/50 mortgage options that enable you to split your mortgage into both fixed and variable portions.
      </p>

      
      <h4>Q: What credit score do I need to qualify?</h4>
      <p>
      Generally speaking, you’re a prime candidate for a mortgage if your credit score is 680 and above. The higher you can get above 700 the better, as you will qualify for the lowest rates. These days almost anyone can obtain a mortgage, but the key for those with lower credit scores is the size of the down payment. If you have a sufficient downpayment, you can reduce the risk to the lender providing you with the mortgage. Statistics show that default rates on mortgages decline as the downpayment increases.
      </p>      
      
      <h4>Q: What happens if my credit score isn’t great?</h4>
      <p>
      There are several things you can do to boost your credit fairly quickly. </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li><b>Pay down credit cards:</b> The number one way to increase your credit score is to pay down your credit cards so they’re below 70%
            of your limits. Revolving credit like credit cards seems to have a more significant impact on credit scores than car loans, lines of credit, and so on.
        </li>
        <li><b>Limit the use of credit cards:</b> Racking up a large amount and then paying it off in monthly instalments can hurt your credit score. If there is a balance at the end of the month, this affects your score – credit formulas don’t take into account the fact that you may have paid the balance off the next month.
        </li>
        <li><b>Check credit limits:</b> If your lender is slower at reporting monthly transactions, this can have a significant impact on how other lenders view your file. Ensure everything’s up to date as old bills that have been paid can come back to haunt you. Some financial institutions don’t even report your maximum limits. As such, the credit bureau is left to only use the balance that’s on hand. The problem is, if you consistently charge the same amount each month – say $1,000 to $1,500 – it may appear to the credit-scoring agencies that you’re regularly maxing out your cards. The best bet is to pay your balances down or off before your statement periods close. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Keep old cards:</b> Older credit is better credit. If you stop using older credit cards, the issuers may stop updating your accounts. As such, the cards can lose their weight in the credit formula and, therefore, may not be as valuable – even though you have had the cards for a long time. Use these cards periodically and then pay them off. 
        </li>
        <li><b>Don’t let mistakes build up:</b> Always dispute any mistakes or situations that may harm your score. If, for instance, a cell phone bill is incorrect and the company will not amend it, you can dispute this by making the credit bureau aware of the situation.    
        </li>
      </ol>    
                  
      <h4>Q: What will my mortgage rate be?</h4>
      <p>
      What always seems to be everyone’s number one concern is saving money. Your mortgage rate depends on a lot of factors.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have bad credit history and a low down payment, expect a higher rate versus someone with a flawless credit history and a large down payment.
        The mortgage rate you  receive will be based on your profile, such as credit score and the property. Most people spend a lot of time to shop around, but through us, we will do the shopping for you.
        By using us, we will shop through different mortgage lenders and help you familiarize with the process so that there are no surprises.
      </p>
     
      <h4>Q: How long is my mortgage rate good for?</h4>
      <p>
      There is a difference in getting a quote on a mortgage rate verus a locked-in rate. With us, once you are happy 
      with the quoted rate, we will finalize the details with the lender and lock in the rate, so even if rates change from one day to the next, your rate won’t.                
      </p>

      <h4>Q: How do you calculate a mortgage payment?</h4>
      <p>
      Your mortgage payment is calculated based on the amount you borrow, the agreed mortgage rate, and the term of the mortgage.
      You can try our  <a routerLink="/calculator/monthlyPayment">mortgage payment calculator here</a>.
      </p>      
      
      <h4>Q: What is a refinance?</h4>
      <p>
      Refinancing simply means obtaining new financing for something you already own (or partially own, like real estate). 
      If you currently have a rate of 5% on your mortgage, but see that refinance rates are now 3%, a refinance could save you money. 
      You’d essentially have one lender pay off your existing loan with a brand new loan at the lower interest rate.
      </p>      

      <h4>Q: When is the first payment due?</h4>
      <p>
      This depends on when you close your home and what your payment schedule is. 
      Generally speaking, your first payment will be on the next payment schedule. </p>
      
      <h4>Q: How much will I have to pay for closing costs?</h4>
      <p>   
      As a general rule of thumb, it’s recommended that you put aside at least 1.5% of the purchase price (in addition to the down payment) strictly to cover closing costs. There are several items you should budget for when it comes to closing costs. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property Transfer Tax is charged whenever a property is purchased. The tax will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. You can use our <a routerLink="/calculator/ontarioLandTransferTax">Ontario Land Transfer Tax Calculator</a> to find out.</li>
        <li>GST/HST is only charged on new homes, and does not affect homes priced at less than $400,000. Even homes that exceed the price threshold are only taxed on the portion that exceeds $400,000. Certain conditions may apply.</li>
        <li>Your lawyer/notary will charge you a fee for drawing up the mortgage and conveyance of title. The amount of the fee will depend on the individual that you use. The typical cost is $900 to $1,200.</li>
        <li>If you’re purchasing a single-family home, you’ll need to give your lender a survey certificate showing where the property sits within the property lines. Some exceptions are made, however, on low loan-to-value deals and acreage properties. A survey will cost approximately $300-$350, but the lender will often accept a copy of an existing survey.</li>
        <li>Other costs include such things as an appraisal fee (approximately $200), title insurance and a home inspection (approximately $350).</li>
      </ul>
